Our goal is to test translation of c programs to rust. We want to analyzing runtime performance and see if there are any differences in why rust might run slower than c. We presume that this is due to the rust compiler enforcing checks such as integer overflows or out of bounds checks. We would also like to analyze hardware statistics such as cache misses, cycles and other metrics to see the differences in C and Rust. Given our results, we would like to see how rust code can be improved in performance and how we can do so by changing the code or hardware.
